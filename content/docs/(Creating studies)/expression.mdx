Expressions are any type of (numerical) data series.
In their simplest form, they represent historical values of stocks,
or of other type of assets, as represented by their symbol.
More complex expressions can be created by means of indicators, operations,
and any combination thereof, hence creating new indicators.

### Examples

- Apple Inc. historical data

```
AAPL
```

- A simple 200-day moving average:

```
sma(AAPL, 200)
```

- A complex expression:

```
sma(AAPL, 200) + sma( stddev(AAPL, 50), 20 )
```
