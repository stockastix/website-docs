import { Pre, CodeBlock } from "fumadocs-ui/components/codeblock";
import { PROJECT } from "@stockastix/meta";

export const description = `Your first steps with ${PROJECT}`;

In this introduction, you will build a custom indicator step-by-step,
as a typical showcase of what you can do with {PROJECT}.
Of course, {PROJECT} allows for much more, including _backtesting_ and _optimizing_.
But indicators are at the root of each trading strategy.

## 1. Create a study

<Callout>
  A _study_ is a place where you can define, refine, and test indicators and
  trading strategies. You can save studies in your personal space so you can use
  them later on, and/or work on several studies in parallel.
</Callout>

Click <code>new study</code> from your account top right-hand corner menu.
This will open a page to enter general information about the study:

- give it a **_name_**,
- an optional **description**,
- whether it is **private** or not (i.e. visible to everyone, or just to yourself),
- and most importantly, specify which **type** of study you are about to make.
  In our particular case, leave the default value <code>time</code>.
  This tells that you are about to build an indicator,
  and you are willing to visualize it over time.

When you are good to go, click the <code>Create study</code> button.

## 2. Build your custom indicator

For the sake of this guide, you are going to build the RSI indicator from scratch
(RSI is a well-known indicator in technical analysis).
This is for illustration-purpose only, because the rsi indicator is built-in the tool:
you normally do not need to build it by yourself.

<Callout>
  Whenever an indicator is natively available, it is recommended to resort to
  the built-in indicator: not only is it simpler, but it also improves
  performance.
</Callout>

### 2.1 Define aliases

Aliases are handy names that can be used in place of more complex [expressions](./docs/expression). You can choose whatever name you like,
and assign it an (expression) value. Once an alias is defined, you can use it anywhere
in subsequent expressions.

`^DJI` represents the [symbol](./docs/symbols) for the Dow Jones historical data.
You could very well use this symbol through all of the tutorial,
but defining a more explicit name is handy.

<CodeBlock title="Create an explicit alias for the Dow Jones index symbol">
  <Pre>`Dow = ^DJI`</Pre>
</CodeBlock>

<Callout>
  Tip: you can copy/paste the examples from this page directly into the tool.
</Callout>

In the next lines, `previous`, `ema`, `max` are all built-in indicators
(check their respective documentation page if you would like to learn more).
`delta`, `AverageGain` and `AverageLoss` become aliases for the right-hand side of the equal sign.

<CodeBlock title="Stores each daily variation of the Dow index">
  <Pre>`delta = Dow - previous(Dow, 1)`</Pre>
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="Creates exponential moving averages of daily gains and daily losses">
  <Pre>
`AverageGain = ema( max(delta, 0), 27)`

`AverageLoss = ema( -min(delta, 0), 27)`

  </Pre>
</CodeBlock>

Finally, define your custom indicator, as per the [RSI definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_strength_index):

<CodeBlock title="Creates custom indicator">
  <Pre>`MyCustomRSI = 100 * AverageGain / ( AverageLoss + AverageGain )`</Pre>
</CodeBlock>

### 2.2 Draw on a chart

Now, you can visualise the indicator. In the _draw_ section, under _Axis #1_, enter:

```
MyCustomRSI
```

Should you want to visualize altogether with the Dow Jones historical data,
click to create a second axis, and request to draw the stock index as well:

```
Dow
```

You could also draw the RSI by using the built-in indicator:

```
rsi(Dow, 14)
```

If you draw it in the same axis as your custom RSI indicator,
only a single line will show on the graph: this is because the custom indicator
is exactly the same as the native RSI, so the latter exactly overlaps the former.

Feel free to play by changing the period of the RSI, or change the underlying asset;
update the graph with the new settings.

Congratulations, you have created your first indicator
and are now ready to create your own!
