Indicators are data series built upon other data series.
They are usually parameterizable. Therefore, a technical indicator
will take as input an [expression](./expression), and one or more numerical values.

In {PROJECT}, the concept of indicators encompasses all technical indicators
that are typically referred to in trading. It is also broader in scope,
as it includes any type of transformation.

Refer to specific technical indicators for details on each indicator.
